# Arsenal Scripting

`arsenal_scripting` is a crate designed to provide a language agnostic scripting interface on top of the [Bevy] game engine. This is **highly** experimental and the design is under constant re-evaluation at this point. Arsenal Scripting is primarily intended to be included as a core plugin in the [Arsenal Runtime](../arsenal_runtime).
