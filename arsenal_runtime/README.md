# Arsenal Runtime

The Arsenal Runtime is the binary that actually executes an Arsenal game. It is essentially just a tiny Bevy game that includes the Bevy plugins necessary for Arsenal. These plugins include things like the Arsenal Scripting plugin and other core plugins such as the Blender scene system.
