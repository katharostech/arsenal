Arsenal is a Blender game engine written in Rust and developed by [Katharos Technology][Katharostech.com]. The project is in very early stages of development, but we are doing the planning, investigation, experimentation, and documentation that is necessary to get the project going.

The documentation can be found at [katharostech.github.io/arsenal](https://katharostech.github.io/arsenal). We have [downloads](https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal/releases) of Arsenal for 64bit Windows, Mac, and Linux, and a [Getting Started](https://katharostech.github.io/arsenal/getting-started.html) guide that will walk you through testing it out.

Updates on Arsenal development are posted on the [Arsenal Feed][arsenal_feed] at [Katharostech.com].
