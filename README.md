# Arsenal

Arsenal is the idea for a Blender integrated game engine written in Rust. There is no game engine yet, it is just an idea, but we are doing the planning, investigation, experimentation, and documentation that is necessary to get the project started.

The documentation can be found at [katharostech.github.io/arsenal](https://katharostech.github.io/arsenal).
